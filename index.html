            <h2> Motivation & Goal </h2>
            <p> Flight ticket prices usually fluctuate a lot and can be very difficult to guess. The airline industry is
                considered as one of the most sophisticated industry in using complex pricing strategies. Pricing in
                airplane tickets could be a brain game between airline companies and customers - airplane companies
                always try to maintain a high revenue, while travelers are usually seeking to find a ticket at its
                lowest price. In order to uncover the mysterious pattern of flight ticket prices, we will try to utilize
                some machine learning techniques and build models to predict the flight prices. Ultimately, we can
                provide multiple price predictions for users to refer to so that they can optimize their travelling
                plan.</p>

            <h2> Course & Project Introduction </h2>
            <p> As the final project for the course IDS 706: Data Engineering and DataOps, we aimed to apply and
                integrate cloud computing techniques that we learned throughout the semester to build this end-to-end
                prediction tool. In the context of this project, we would like to build the entire data pipeline and
                integrate following cloud computing techniques: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Amazon SageMaker</b>: build and train the ML model</li>
                <li><b>AWS S3 Website</b>: build interactive website for the end users</li>
                <li><b>AWS Lambda</b>: take user input, preprocess data, invoke model endpoint, output predictions</li>
            </ul>
