            <h2> Data, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization </h2>
            <p> We are using a dataset from Kaggle: <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/zernach/2018-airplane-flights"> Cleaned 2018 Flights </a> <br>
                This dataset contains more than <b>9 million</b> cleaned domestic U.S. flight observations and <b>13 data fields</b>.
                After removal of irrelevant data fields from the data, we finialized on using the following variables in our model: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Quarter (Categorical)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Airline Company (Categorical)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Origin (Categorical)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Destination (Categorical)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Number of Tickets Ordered (Numerical)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2> The Model: Linear Regression </h2>
            <p>
                Our modeling process contains of three components: construct preprocessor, build model, and validate model.
                Our modeling process heavily depends on the Python module Scikit-Learn. <br><br> 
                <b> Step 1: Construct Preprocessor </b>
                <br>
                There are five predictor variables, and four of them are categorical. Since machine learning models cannot directly interpret categorical values, 
                these variables has to transform into numbers through One-Hot-Encoding. Utilizing the pre-built Scikit-Learn One-Hot-Encoder and ColumnTransformer,
                a preprocessor was built. The preprocessor takes in a Pandas DataFrame and outputs a 2D array. Both the model training process and the final product
                will utilize this preprocessor to prepare the data.
                <br><br>
                <b> Step 2: Build Model </b>
                After the cateforical features are transformed appropriately, we trained and tested three different machien learning models -- Linear Regression, 
                Support Vector Machine Regression, and Random Forest Regression. 
                <br><br>
                <b> Step 3: Validate Model </b>
